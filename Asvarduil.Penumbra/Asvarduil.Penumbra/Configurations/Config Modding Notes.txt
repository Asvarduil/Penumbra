Server.cfg:
-----------
Denote all touched settings with +, settings that should be explicitly ignored with -.

+ SECTOR_SIZE                     (default value: 4000 m3/sector) - Changes how large individual sectors of a system are.
+ FLEET_OUT_OF_SECTOR_MOVEMENT    (default value: 6000 ms/sector) - How long does it take a fleet to cross a single sector?
                                                                    Increased, due to increased sector size.  Increase should be proportional to sector size.
+ DEFAULT_BLUEPRINT_ENEMY_USE     (default value: true)           - If true, blueprints are usable by random enemies by default.
                                                                    This often annoys players so I turned it off.
                                                                    Players can override this on a blueprint-by-blueprint basis.
+ DEFAULT_BLUEPRINT_OTHERS_BUY    (default value: true)           - If true, people outside of the uploaders faction can buy a blueprint.
+ DEFAULT_BLUEPRINT_HOME_BASE_BUY (default value: true)           - ...Not really sure, but I turned it off.
+ THRUST_SPEED_LIMIT              (default value: 150 m/s)        - Maximum thrust.  Reduced due to smaller ship sizes.
                                                                    This was discussed on the MicroMade thread.  I expect this will be a constant source of editing...
+ SERVER_LIST_NAME                (default value: NoName)         - Publicly broadcast server name.
+ SERVER_LIST_DESCRIPTION         (default value: NoDescription)  - Publicly broadcast server description.
+ MAX_CLIENTS                     (default value: 8)              - Maximum number of clients who can connect to the server.
+ NT_BLOCK_QUEUE_SIZE             (default value: 1024 b/u)       - Determines how many blocks are sent per update.  Big numbers load more blocks, but hurt performance.  
                                                                    Smaller numbers make big structures load more slowly.  Should be a power of two?
                                                                    Decreased to help clients with weaker systems.  Will edit as needed.
+ MAX_CHAIN_DOCKING               (default value: 25)             - Maximum amount of entities that can be docked in a single chain.  
                                                                    Decreased for performance reasons.
- BATTLE_MODE_CONFIG              --                              - Ignore this, it's for a PvP-only mode, which I'm not doing.

Gameconfig.xml:

/GameConfig/ShipMassLimit (Does this exist?)
    Per conversation with Tunk, mass limits for ships and stations can be implemented in Gameconfig.xml.
    Is this the right tag?

/GameConfig/StationMassLimit (Does this exist?)
    See above.

customBlockBehaviorConfigTemplate.xml:
--------------------------------------
Block Behavior configuration lets one change how weapons behave.
