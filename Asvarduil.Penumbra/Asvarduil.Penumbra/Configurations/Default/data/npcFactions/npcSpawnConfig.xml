            <Description>The Trading Guild is a collection of large corporations. They work to better themselves primarily through trade and economics.
The Trading Guild treats others with neutrality, and they hardly care who or what they sell their products to. Their wealth grants them strength, but they are a relatively peaceful faction.<!--Description of the faction--></Description>

            <Name>Outcasts<!--Name of the faction--></Name>
            <Description>The Outcasts is a loose organization comprised of many different alien species. The harshness of space has left these people without a home, and so they rely on each to survive. The Outcasts are not particularly strong, 
but treat outsiders with justifiable wariness. The Outcasts are spread thin across the stars and seek to avoid the attention of others.<!--Description of the faction--></Description>

            <Name>Scavengers<!--Name of the faction--></Name>
            <Description>The Scavengers are a violent people. They care only for themselves, and are willing to do whatever it takes to achieve their goals. Space is a bleak place, and it has driven them to the extremes.
Their unwillingness to work with others leaves them at a disadvantage. As a result, the Scavengers are fairly weak. They are little more than a nuisance to many other factions.<!--Description of the faction--></Description>
