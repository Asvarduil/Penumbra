Server.cfg:
-----------
Denote all touched settings with +, settings that should be explicitly ignored with -.

+ PROTECT_STARTING_SECTOR                 (default value: false)          - Ensures that things can't be destroyed in the starting sector.
                                                                            True so that the spawn sector can be reliably safe.
- PLANET_SIZE_MEAN                        (default value: r50)            - On average, planets will have a radius of this value.
                                                                            Kept at minimum value (50) for best possible performance.
- PLANET_SIZE_DEVIATION                   (default value: 0.0)            - Determines standard deviation for planet sizes.  Will need to do maths to figure out
                                                                            what kind of effect this would have.
+ SECTOR_AUTOSAVE_SEC                     (default value: 600 s/save)     - Determines how long periodic saves occur.
                                                                            This setting should be play-tested for what feels best and offers best performance.
+ SECTOR_SIZE                             (default value: 4000 m3/sector) - Changes how large individual sectors of a system are.
                                                                            Due to ships being small, this value needs to be bigger such that it's harder for
                                                                            ships to 'zone-out' and render combat irritating.
+ FLEET_OUT_OF_SECTOR_MOVEMENT            (default value: 6000 ms/sector) - How long does it take a fleet to cross a single sector?
                                                                            Increased, due to increased sector size.  Increase should be proportional to sector size.
+ ONLY_ALLOW_FACTION_SHIPS_ADDED_TO_FLEET (default value: false)          - Ensures that only factioned ships can be included in fleets.
                                                                            Recommended by Batavium.
+ DEFAULT_BLUEPRINT_ENEMY_USE             (default value: true)           - If true, blueprints are usable by random enemies by default.
                                                                            This often annoys players so I turned it off.
                                                                            Players can override this on a blueprint-by-blueprint basis.
+ DEFAULT_BLUEPRINT_OTHERS_BUY            (default value: true)           - If true, people outside of the uploaders faction can buy a blueprint.
+ DEFAULT_BLUEPRINT_HOME_BASE_BUY         (default value: true)           - ...Not really sure, but I turned it off.
+ THRUST_SPEED_LIMIT                      (default value: 150 m/s)        - Maximum thrust.  Reduced due to smaller ship sizes.
                                                                            This was discussed on the MicroMade thread.  I expect this will be a constant source of editing...
+ SERVER_LIST_NAME                        (default value: NoName)         - Publicly broadcast server name.
+ SERVER_LIST_DESCRIPTION                 (default value: NoDescription)  - Publicly broadcast server description.
+ MAX_CLIENTS                             (default value: 8)              - Maximum number of clients who can connect to the server.
+ NT_BLOCK_QUEUE_SIZE                     (default value: 1024 b/u)       - Determines how many blocks are sent per update.  Big numbers load more blocks, but hurt performance.  
                                                                            Smaller numbers make big structures load more slowly.  Should be a power of two?
                                                                            Decreased to help clients with weaker systems.  Will edit as needed.
+ MAX_CHAIN_DOCKING                       (default value: 25)             - Maximum amount of entities that can be docked in a single chain.  
                                                                            Decreased for performance reasons.
- BATTLE_MODE_CONFIG                      --                              - Ignore this, it's for a PvP-only mode, which I'm not doing.
