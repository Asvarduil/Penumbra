Server.cfg:
-----------
Denote all touched settings with +, settings that should be explicitly ignored with -.

+ PROTECT_STARTING_SECTOR                 (default value: false)          - Ensures that things can't be destroyed in the starting sector.
                                                                            True so that the spawn sector can be reliably safe.
- PLANET_SIZE_MEAN                        (default value: r50)            - On average, planets will have a radius of this value.
                                                                            Kept at minimum value (50) for best possible performance.
- PLANET_SIZE_DEVIATION                   (default value: 0.0)            - Determines standard deviation for planet sizes.  Will need to do maths to figure out
                                                                            what kind of effect this would have.
+ SECTOR_AUTOSAVE_SEC                     (default value: 600 s/save)     - Determines how long periodic saves occur.
                                                                            This setting should be play-tested for what feels best and offers best performance.
+ SECTOR_SIZE                             (default value: 4000 m3/sector) - Changes how large individual sectors of a system are.
                                                                            Due to ships being small, this value needs to be bigger such that it's harder for
                                                                            ships to 'zone-out' and render combat irritating.
+ FLEET_OUT_OF_SECTOR_MOVEMENT            (default value: 6000 ms/sector) - How long does it take a fleet to cross a single sector?
                                                                            Increased, due to increased sector size.  Increase should be proportional to sector size.
+ ONLY_ALLOW_FACTION_SHIPS_ADDED_TO_FLEET (default value: false)          - Ensures that only factioned ships can be included in fleets.
                                                                            Recommended by Batavium.
+ DEFAULT_BLUEPRINT_ENEMY_USE             (default value: true)           - If true, blueprints are usable by random enemies by default.
                                                                            This often annoys players so I turned it off.
                                                                            Players can override this on a blueprint-by-blueprint basis.
+ DEFAULT_BLUEPRINT_OTHERS_BUY            (default value: true)           - If true, people outside of the uploaders faction can buy a blueprint.
+ DEFAULT_BLUEPRINT_HOME_BASE_BUY         (default value: true)           - ...Not really sure, but I turned it off.
+ THRUST_SPEED_LIMIT                      (default value: 150 m/s)        - Maximum thrust.  Reduced due to smaller ship sizes.
                                                                            This was discussed on the MicroMade thread.  I expect this will be a constant source of editing...
+ SERVER_LIST_NAME                        (default value: NoName)         - Publicly broadcast server name.
+ SERVER_LIST_DESCRIPTION                 (default value: NoDescription)  - Publicly broadcast server description.
+ MAX_CLIENTS                             (default value: 8)              - Maximum number of clients who can connect to the server.
+ NT_BLOCK_QUEUE_SIZE                     (default value: 1024 b/u)       - Determines how many blocks are sent per update.  Big numbers load more blocks, but hurt performance.  
                                                                            Smaller numbers make big structures load more slowly.  Should be a power of two?
                                                                            Decreased to help clients with weaker systems.  Will edit as needed.
+ MAX_CHAIN_DOCKING                       (default value: 25)             - Maximum amount of entities that can be docked in a single chain.  
                                                                            Decreased for performance reasons.
- BATTLE_MODE_CONFIG                      --                              - Ignore this, it's for a PvP-only mode, which I'm not doing.

GameConfig.xml:
---------------
All identifiers are XPaths, in the event that XML needs to be scanned.

/GameConfig/StartingGear/Credits (default value: 20000 cr)        - How many credits a newbie starts with.  Decreased to zero.

/GameConfig/StartingGear/Block - Adds default blocks to the player inventory.
    Id is the block ID to grant
    Count is the number of blocks to grant
    Slot is either 'hotbar' or 'inventory'.

/GameConfig/StartingGear/Tool - Adds tools to the player inventory.
    SubId is the tool's ID
    Slot is either 'hotbar' or 'inventory'

/GameConfig/StartingGear/Helmet - It's a hat! >:|

/GameConfig/StartingGear/Logbook - Adds a logbook to the player inventory.
    Message is the starting contents of the logbook.
    Slot is either 'hotbar' or 'inventory'

The below paths can have values in either Mass, or Blocks.
Blocks determines the max number of blocks you can have, while
Mass denotes the max mass an entity can have.

/GameConfig/ShipLimits/Mass - Determine mass limit for starships.
/GameConfig/PlanetLimits/Mass - Determine mass limit for planets.
/GameConfig/StationLimits/Mass - Determine mass limit for stations.

/data/npcFactions
-----------------
This folder is where one defines what factions appear in generated universes, how they behave,
and most importantly what ships and stations are spawned.

npcSpawnConfig.xml - Determines what factions spawn, where they spawn, and how big they are initially.

Subfolders - must match the 'presets' name in npcSpawnConfig.xml.  (e.g. if Faction 'A' has a <Presets> tag with 'A', a subfolder
with path /data/npcFactions/A should exist)
Each subfolder must have: 
 - A npcConfig.xml in it; this determines how factions interact with each other and react to players
   doing stuff (attacking, declaring war, declaring peace, trading, etc.)
 - A blueprints.zip file.  This file should contain all blueprints that the faction can possibly spawn.

/data/config/BlockBehaviorConfig.xml:
-------------------------------------
Changes how weapons behave.  As this is XML, all identifiers are XPaths.

/data/config/BlockConfig.xml:
-----------------------------
Block Config lets you modify existing game blocks.

/data/config/BlockConfigImport.xml:
-----------------------------------
Allows you to import custom blocks into the game!

/data/config/FactionConfig.xml:
-------------------------------
Change faction bonuses for mining and how faction points work.

/data/config/tipps.txt:
-----------------------
All loading screen tips are displayed in this text file.  Changing this makes custom loading messages appear.
