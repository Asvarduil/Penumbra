To keep a persistent faction config throughout updates, rename the customBlockBehaviorConfigTemplate.xml 
in the directory ./customBlockBehaviorConfig to customBlockBehaviorConfig.xml 
and edit it to your liking. 

The result will be a merge of anything in your custom config with the default values 
from the data/config dir for missing ones.
