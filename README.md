# Penumbra
The Penumbra backend for the MicroMade mod extends StarMade with new commands and functionality.

Penumbra is written in C#, and works by scanning StarMade's Error output stream for specific events.  These events are coded to be recognized by Penumbra.  When a particular command or event is recognized, data is changed in our backend, and then Penumbra emits specific / commands to make the game respond as we desire.

The point of Penumbra is to enhance StarMade with features that the game's developers are presently too busy to add, but that need to be included so that we can have a better game.

## Installation Instructions
_In Progress.  It may be some time before this is ready for installation._

## Planned Features
+ Quest System: Commonly requested, and would be beneficial for the game design.
+ Baked-in RP: Having the game systems reward a degree of RP would be helpful for immersion.
